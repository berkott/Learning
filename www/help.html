    <div class="content">To reserve book, all the user must do is search for the book they would like to reserve either by searching it up, or locating it in the catalog. To place a hold, the user must simply press the reserve button when it is shown. The user will then have placed a hold on the book, which they will be reminded about when that hold is ready for pickup.

    <div class="title">Checkout</div>
    <div class="content">
    To checkout a book, users must have the physical copy that they would like to check out (obtained by visiting the library). Once the user has the physical copy, they can scan the barcode on the back and follow the instructions on the checkout page. If users are unable to scan the book then they can also enter the ISBN (also found on the back of the book) of the book to be checked out. All books are checked out to the user for 2 weeks.

    <div class="title">Administrator Privileges</div>
    <div class="content">
      Administrators are able to edit books in the database, manage returns, accounts, and change the school associated with different users (which updates their map etc.). In order to do this, administrators log into Google Firebase (SmartLib's backend service) and make all changes from there. Firebase is very easy to use as it has a simple and intuitive user interface.
